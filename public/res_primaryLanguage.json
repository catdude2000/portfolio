I've always been interested in how coding works, so when I got the opportunity to learn at DeltaV Code School, I was excited to take it.  I want to have a positive impact on tech culture as well as the rest of the world.  I'm interested in developing software purposed for entertainment as well as software for practical uses.  I'm certain my experience in customer service will help me create user-friendly front-end experiences and easy to read back-end code.  I feel this will make me an invaluable member of any team that I work with and I hope you can utilize my skills for an exciting career.",
